# lyndon-factors

Code for the calculation of enhanced Lyndon factorisation of a string, by choosing a more suitable alphabet reordering. 

The code here is a prototype implementation of the algorithm, not yet optimised for efficiency.

Makes use of David Eppstein's implementation of Lyndon factorisation https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/Lyndon.py
